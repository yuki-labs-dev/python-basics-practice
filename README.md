# python-basics-practice
Practice Python notebook based on DataCamp Intro to Python course.

It demonstrates familiarity with foundational Python concepts, including:

- variables and numeric operations
- strings and string methods
- lists and list manipulation
- indexing and slicing
- built-in functions (len, type, print)
- importing and using packages (NumPy)
- basic data handling

This repository is part of my ongoing portfolio as I build Python skills to support data work, text processing, and AI/NLP annotation projects.
